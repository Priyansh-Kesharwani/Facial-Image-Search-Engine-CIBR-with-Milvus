# Facial-Image-Search-Engine-CIBR-with-Milvus

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a robust facial image search engine using Milvus, an open-source vector database. This application allows for fast and accurate searches for similar face images based on deep-learned facial embeddings.

## Application Architecture

The application consists of two key components:

1. **Facial Encoder**: This component generates semantic vector embeddings for face images using deep learning models.

2. **Milvus Search Index**: It performs efficient similarity search and retrieval on the facial vectors.

## Facial Encoder

The facial encoder follows these steps to create a 512-dimensional embedding vector for each face image:

1. **Face Detection**: Utilizes MTCNN (via facenet-pytorch) to identify and crop facial regions.

2. **Feature Extraction**: The cropped faces are passed through a pretrained InceptionResnetV1 model from VGGFace2 to output feature vectors.

3. **Embedding Generation**: The model embeddings are processed to generate the final 512-dimensional float vectors.


## Milvus Setup

Milvus provides the vector index and search capabilities for the application. The following steps are used to set up Milvus:

1. Install Milvus server locally or on cloud infrastructure.

2. Create a Milvus collection called 'face_search' with appropriate fields.

3. Define an IVF_FLAT index on the embedding vector field for efficient search.

4. Insert facial vectors from the encoder into the Milvus collection.

5. Optimize index parameters like `nlist` for optimal performance.


## Search Pipeline

To perform a search, a query image passes through the facial encoder to generate its embedding vector. This vector is used to query Milvus:

1. Connect to the Milvus server and access the 'face_search' collection.

2. Pass the query embedding to Milvus' vector similarity search.

3. Retrieve the top N closest matches based on the Euclidean distance of vectors.

4. Return image filenames/metadata associated with matched face vectors.


## Conclusion

This facial image search engine combines state-of-the-art deep learning with Milvus' purpose-built vector search capabilities. It can reliably scale to billions of face images for applications like de-duplication and identity search.

Some possible next steps include integrating with front-end apps, deploying to cloud infrastructure, and optimizing for large datasets. Overall, this showcases how Milvus can enable robust and scalable similarity search in domains like facial recognition.
